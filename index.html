									<h2> Food Network </h2>
									<p>  As a developer, our aim is to create a platform that provides a diverse and engaging collection of food-related content, including recipes, cooking tips, and video tutorials from well-known chefs. The platform will have a clean and modern design, with a user-friendly interface, and a well-organized navigation menu, making it easy for users to find what they are looking for.</br>
										To ensure high performance, we will develop the platform using robust applications with reusable, efficient, and testable code. Security will be a top priority, with effective security protocols, data protection measures, and storage solutions in place to safeguard user data. We will regularly run diagnostic tests and perform repairs as needed to ensure the platform is functioning optimally, and provide top-notch technical support to our users.</br>
										Our development process will be well-documented, with detailed reports outlining Node.js processes, including database schemas, and all relevant technical information. We will use a Micro-services architecture built using AWS Infrastructure Maintenance to ensure scalability and flexibility as the platform grows.</br>
										Finally, we will follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, which will involve writing automated tests for each feature before writing the code, ensuring that the code is functional, reliable, and free of errors. This will help us achieve our desired goal of creating a platform that is engaging, user-friendly, and delivers an exceptional experience to our users.

									<p>  As a developer, I have experience building high-performance applications that integrate with third-party POS systems and implement business logic, such as customer segmentation.
										I prioritise writing testable, reusable, and efficient code while implementing security protocols, data protection measures, and storage solutions. I am skilled in Node.js, AWS Infrastructure Maintenance, and Micro-services architecture.
										Additionally, I follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to achieve my goals and document Node.js processes, including database schemas. I have a passion for developing new enterprise business use cases and advocating for them across my team.

										<h2>P2P Lending (Pinbee)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="/images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>We are developing a platform of integrated P2P Lending Systems, Credit Scoring and E-money. The platform shall have a 95% automated system that will reduce the cost significantly compared to similar platforms, consisting of 40-50% operating manually in the Indonesian market. 
									We employ artificial intelligence and big data to build a robust credit scoring system. We use artificial intelligence to build a self-development dictionary of Bahasa as a tool to understand the intent of words and sentences. Artificial intelligence is also used for perfecting the credit scoring model based on the data of non-performing loans.
